* This project was built to help identify bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. It was discovered that bacteria found in the human body, specifically in the belly button, may be used for this. By looking at these charts in the dashboard we can identify which bacteria species live in the human body and can then potentially be used.
